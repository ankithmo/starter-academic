abstract: 'Identification of influential nodes in a social network is an interesting problem since these nodes assist in faster information propagation in the network. In the current work, the procedures based on Cole and Weiss are used to identify influentials in networks of various sizes and their performances are analyzed. Further it is established that preprocessing techniques like clustering and sampling improve the performance of Cole and Weiss procedures. Finally, the computational resources required for these procedures are estimated based on network properties.'
