Iâ€™m a graduate student at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science advised by Professor [Aiichiro Nakano](http://cacs.usc.edu/people/nakano.php) and Professor [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/). My research interests are in network analysis, geometric and quantum deep learning, and high performance computing. Particularly, I focus on developing deep learning techniques for network analysis problems by exploiting high-performance and quantum computing architectures.

Before joining USC, I was a research assistant at the Indian Statistical Institute with Professor [Saroj Kumar Meher](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~saroj.meher/), where I worked on feature engineering of geological data. I was also a research associate at M. S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology with Professor [Krishnaraj P M](http://www.msrit.edu/department/faculty-detail.html?dept=ise&ID=8), where I collaborated on a textbook focusing on the practical aspects of social network analysis.
