title: "Alleviating the noisy data problem using Restricted Boltzmann machines"
summary: "Most datasets have some form of noise which affects the downward machine learning task. When we are provided with a clean training dataset, a deep neural network trained on this clean dataset, and a noisy test dataset; we explore the possibility of denoising the test data without having to retraining the model by exploiting the denoising capabilities of restricted Boltzmann machines and the representations of the hidden layers of the deep neural network."
