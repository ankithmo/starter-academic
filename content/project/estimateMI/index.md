title: "Estimating information flow in deep neural networks"
summary: 'Implementation of "Estimating Differential
Entropy under Gaussian Convolutions" (2019), Ziv Goldfeld, Kristjan Greenewald, Yury Polyanskiy Here we estimate the mutual information between the input layer and each of the hidden layer representations using a noisy deep neural network, where additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is injected to each of these representations. We further extend this work to estimate information flow in graph neural networks.'
